# Before "Recommender Systems"

- Manual personalization
    - hire agent who finds you place to go
    - clothes store consultant
- Cross-sales and early product assosiation
    - if we are putting sale on hamburgers it is good to put ketchup nearby
    - grown from intuition and exprerience
- Product search


# Early Days

- 1992-1996
    - Research: Grouplens, RINGO, Video Recommender and more...
    - Industry developments: Amazon and beyond
        - people can't browse all stuff
        - discover what to present in different contex
    - Early Commercialization: Agents, Inc., Net Perceptions, and many more...
        - stores were buying recommenders
    - Mix of business excitement and altruistic dreams
        - not just sell products but help people explore all the options available for their own purposes


# Tech Bubble and the Burst

- Recommendation as key technology (till 2000)
    - you are gonna make a lot of money if you put right recommendation at right place in right time
- Recommendation in context (till 2006)
    - cooling off
    - realalized that it is not the key technology
    - other business things are important too
    - growing slowly


# Wave Two: The Netflix Prize (2006)

- New excitement in recommender systems 
    - netflix $1,000,000
    - recommendation as an application area for data mining, machine learining
    - rapid growth in the field
- New techniques
    - algorithms stacking
    - new matrix factorization techniques


# Mature Realization

- Prediction and basic top-N algorithms limited
    - magic barriers (can recommend more accurately)
        - people too inconsistent
        - help people rate better
    - value of recommendation
        - do not recommend if person gonna purchase anyway
    - context of recommendation
    - content to recommend


# State of the Field Today (2016)

- Algorithms well-known
- Effective recommendation still a craft
    - exploring data
    - understanding a data
    - what you are trying to get out of a recommendation
    - understanding usage cases and value proporsition 
- Still largely focused on business applications
    - a lot of creativity
    - dream of recommenders for the sake of a consumer is not realized


# Looking Forward

- Many hard problems unsolved
    - temporal recommendations
    - recommendation for education
        - can we figure out what class to take next based on what have you learned before; what version of the lesson will be more effective
    - low-frequency, high-stakes recommendations
        - house buying
        - car purchase
        - never enough data to learn these preferences
- Recognized speciality that brings together
    - ML / Data mining
    - business / marketing
    - human-computer interaction / understanding consumers


# Promising Directions

- Context of recommendation
- Sequences of all types
    - what videos follow each other
    - what music sequences
    - education
- Lifetime value
    - exploit vs. explore
        - exploit what we know to recommend
        - explore new items to learn more
