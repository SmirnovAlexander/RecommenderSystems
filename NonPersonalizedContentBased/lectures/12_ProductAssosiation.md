# Product Association

-   "People who bought this also bought ..."
-   Look for items that were bought together

# Ephemeral, Contextual Personalization

-   Not long-lasting, for a moment
-   Tight to current activity, not to a person
-   Current navigation is a reflection of current interest
-   Does not reflect any long-term knowledge of preferences

# How to Compute

-   Manual Cross-Sell Tables
    -   generated by marketers to reflect perceived cross-sales or up-sales
    -   if in electronics shop looking for a TV, you might get recommender TV a little more expensive
    -   suggest cable for TV
-   Data Mining Associations
    -   What are we looking for?
        -   Mostly likely to be bought in this context?
        -   Mostly extra-likely to be bought in this context?

# Computing

-   Percentage of X-buyers who also bought Y; divide the counts...
    -   $\frac{|X \cap Y|}{|X|}$
    -   intuitively right, but is it useful?
    -   doesn't compensate for popularity of Y
-   Bayes' Law
    -   how much more likely Y is than it was before
    -   $\frac{P(Y|X)}{P(Y)}$
-   Association rule mining
    -   non-directional association
        -   how both products make each other more likely
    -   $\frac{P(X \text{AND} Y)}{P(X)P(Y)}$
-   More general association rules look at baskets of products, not just individuals

# Association Rules in Practice

-   Beer and diapers story
    -   they are more likely to be bought together
-   Not just product associations but link associations
    -   people see where people came from and form different recommendations
-   Sports car and leather driving gloves
    -   if you buy sports car it is easy to sell driving gloves
    -   vice versa is not working
-   Are all recommendations worth making?
    -   business rules
    -   do not recommend things you don't have

# Take-away lessons

-   Product association recommenders use present context to provide more relevant recommendations
    -   current products; path; links
-   Can compute product association from prior transaction history
    -   balance between high-probability and increased probability
-   Such recommendations can be targeted for additional or replacement purchases
