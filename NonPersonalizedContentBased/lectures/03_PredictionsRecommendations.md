# Prediction

- Estimation of how much you'll like an item
    - often scaled to match some rating
    - often tied to search or browsing for specific products


# Recommendation

- Suggestion for items user might like
    - often presented in form "top-n list"
    - may be just placed in front of you
- People losing trust if they see not relevant recommendation


# Predictions and Recommendations

- Often come together 
- Predictions:
    - pros: helps quantify item
    - cons: as soon as you show user item rated 5 star and he doesn't agree it is better to not give a chance to say you are wrong, sometimes just better to give a list
- Recommendations:
    - pros: provides good choices as a default
    - cons: if perceived as top-n, can result in failure to explore (if top few seems poor), if items show are not relevant people are not scrolling it anymore


# Another dimension to consider

- How explicit is the prediction or recommendation (vs. organic)?
    - historically big companies paid for these recommender systems so they wanted users to know that such system exists (explicit)
        - it calls attention
        - customers feel that they are being manipulated, they do not always trust recommender (like in store when salesman go right in your face and tells what you want, natural reaction is pushing back)
    - it is better to just place place items in front of user but not explicitly mention that it is something you might like (books in book store placed in a particular way, it is sort of recommendation)
    - "we think it might be useful to know that other people rated it high, or it is best seller in category"
    - "you might like this"
    - organic presentations try to de-emphasize the prediction or recommendation
- Should find balance between these are the best (top-n) and softer presentation (here are some that might be interesting)
