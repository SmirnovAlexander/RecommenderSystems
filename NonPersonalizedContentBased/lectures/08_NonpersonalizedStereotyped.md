# Why Non-Personalized

- Cold start (little information about users)
- Simple but beneficial
    - recommend popular items
- Online communities such as Reddit
    - display popular posts
- Applications and media where personalization is impossible


# Recommendation in Print

Long tradition of recommendation in print

- Book, movie, music reviews
- 'Goings On About Town' in magazine
- Michelin restaurant guides

Editorially selected (experts judge)


# Aggregate Opinion: Zagat Survey

Aggregates opinions about restaurants from individual users

- Produce ratings on multiple dimensions
- Textual review compiled from individual reviews
- Based on explicit feedback


# Aggregate Opinion: Billboard

Billboard Top 200

- Derived from sales and radio play
- Albums and songs rise based on last week's activity
- Computed over nationwide data
- Based on implicit feedback


# Weak Personalization

Sometimes we know a little about a user

- Zip code or location
- Age, gender, nationality, ethnicity

This can be used for first-pass 'stereotyped' personalization

Product association allow recommendation based on current page / item / context
